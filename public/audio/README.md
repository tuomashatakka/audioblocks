# Audio Files Directory

This directory contains audio samples for the web application.

To use the audio player functionality, add MP3 or WAV audio files to this directory.

Expected files:
- drums.mp3
- bass.mp3  
- synth.mp3
- vocals.mp3

You can replace these with your own files, but make sure to update the references in the AudioController component.
